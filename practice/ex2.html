            <div id="a">            Once upon a time, in a quaint little village nestled between the rolling hills and ancient forests, there lived a young girl named Amelia. Amelia was an ordinary girl in most respects, but she possessed a gift that set her apart from others—she had an enchanted pen.<br>

            <div id="b">            melia's pen had been passed down through generations of her family, and it was said to be imbued with magical properties. When Amelia wrote with the pen, her words came alive on the page, and the stories she penned would leap into existence. Her tales were filled with wonder, mystery, and enchantment, captivating all who read them. <br>
