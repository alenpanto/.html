            <div id="a">            Once upon a time, in a quaint little village nestled between the rolling hills and ancient forests, there lived a young girl named Amelia. Amelia was an ordinary girl in most respects, but she possessed a gift that set her apart from othersâ€”she had an enchanted pen.<br>
