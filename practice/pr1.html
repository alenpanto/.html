        <u><h1>SOLAR SYSTEM</h1></u>
        <P>
            The solar system is a collection of celestial bodies, including the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other objects, that are gravitationally bound together by the Sun's gravitational pull. It is located in the Milky Way galaxy and is just one of billions of such systems in the universe.

        <h2>Here are some key components of our solar system </h2>
           <ul>
            

            <li>The Sun is the central star of the solar system. It is a massive ball of hot, glowing gases that provides light, heat, and energy to the entire system

            </li>
            <li>There are eight recognized planets in our solar system, divided into two main categories:

                Inner Planets (Terrestrial Planets): Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are relatively small, rocky, and closer to the Sun.
            </li>
            <li>Outer Planets (Gas Giants): Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets are much larger and composed primarily of gases and liquids. They are located farther from the Sun

            </li>

           </ul>

           <h2>The study of the solar system</h2>
           <p>The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust. Over time, the material in this cloud came together due to gravitational forces, forming the Sun and the various planets and other objects that make up the system.

            The study of the solar system, known as planetary science or astronomy, has provided valuable insights into the origin and evolution of celestial bodies and the broader universe.
